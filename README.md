| ap73               | Scheduled a time for our weekly meetings. Successfully set up the project environment, and the app is now running on the emulator with correct team number.                                 | Mitchell recommend watching this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZvjSl9dswg to prepare for the next step. You don't have to watch the entire 4 hours in one go; feel free to watch at your own pace. If you're already familiar with the initial setup, you can skip ahead to 41:32, as everyone has completed that part.                       |
